## Web Properties

These properties are useful if you want to add options to your implementation.

An example would be, maybe you want to disable avatars, but do don't want to
change the client side components.  You can do this by adding a property and using it in the components.

The Web Properties is just a object made available when you import them.

You can see some specific examples in the [cookbook](/cookbooks/add-web-property).
