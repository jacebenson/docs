## API Properties

These properties are useful if you want to add options to your implementation.

An example would be, maybe you want to disable emailing, but do don't want to
change the rules that fire off the email.  You can do this by adding a property and using it in the rule as a condition.

The API Properties is just a object made available when you import them.

You can see some specific examples in the [cookbook](/cookbooks/add-api-property).
